10. All the words I seem to try all end up repeating at some point. The words either repeat as "for you ready" or "of the world"

21. Something that I did enjoy about ruby was the regular expressions. I have not dealt with regular expressions much before this lab but I found them very
    interesting and ruby handled them in a efficient and easy way.

22. I found that ruby has a very steep learning curve, in my opinion. I had lots of trouble with the different syntax that it uses. By the end it was not
    as big of an issue just through repetition of using it. Most of my coding is done in object oriented programming languages, so this was out of my element
    and more difficult for me to complete, but I managed.

23. I enjoyed the early parts of this lab setting up the regex portion but the following steps took me many stressful hours to figure out. One aspect
    about this lab that I enjoyed was the regex101.com website that was referred to us. It was very convenient to test my regex before implementing it into
    my code for testing. I could do my own examples to test and see if I would capture all the titles with all the requirements.

24. I spent roughly 13+ hours on this ruby lab.

25. Just from what we have learned in lecture and this lab, I can see the power behind the ruby language. I can see myself using this language in the future
    but not anytime soon out of college unless an employer requires it. With my knowledge on ruby at the moment, I would only handle regular expression
    projects with ruby. I would use other languages I understand better instead of ruby to solve other projects.
